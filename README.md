A firm recently introduced a new bid type, average bidding, as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximum bidding". They want to do an A / B test to see if the new product converts more than maximum bidding. The ultimate success criterion of the firm is Purchase. For this reason, the following study was conducted by focusing on the Purchase metric for statistical tests.
In this data set, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups. These datasets are in separate sheets for ab testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.
